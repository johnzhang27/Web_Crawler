# Web_Crawler
This is a simple Python web crawler that could fetch COVID-19 cases information from https://www.alberta.ca/covid-19-alberta-data.aspx and then store
those data to a MySQL database.

# Future plan
Planning to use JavaScript and MySQL database to create a visualized histogram to show the change of COVID-19 cases.
